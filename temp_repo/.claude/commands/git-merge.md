# Run Git Merge Branches Skill

This command triggers the git-merge-branches skill, which automates merging multiple feature branches into main with conflict detection and test validation.

To use this skill, say something like:
- "Merge all feature branches into main"
- "Help me merge claude/* branches"
- "Integrate feature branches and run tests"

The skill will guide you through:
1. Identifying branches to merge
2. Executing merges with conflict detection
3. Running tests
4. Pushing changes
5. Closing merged branches
