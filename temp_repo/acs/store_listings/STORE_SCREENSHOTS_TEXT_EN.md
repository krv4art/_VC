# 📱 STORE SCREENSHOTS TEXT (ENGLISH)

> **Purpose:** Screenshot overlay text for App Store & Google Play
> **Based on:** Competitive advantage analysis (docs/planning/COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE_ANALYSIS.md)
> **Target:** Highlight 7 key differentiators that beat competitors

---

## 🎯 SCREENSHOT STRATEGY

**Goal:** Show how ACS solves the #1-#5 pain points competitors have:
1. ❌ "Product not found" → ✅ Analyzes ANY product
2. ❌ Barcode-only → ✅ Photo analysis
3. ❌ Generic ratings → ✅ Personalized for YOU
4. ❌ Fear marketing → ✅ Education-first
5. ❌ Aggressive paywall → ✅ Transparent freemium

**Format for each screen:**
- **HEADLINE** (Bold, 24-32pt) - Benefit, not feature
- **Subheadline** (16-20pt) - Supporting detail
- **Optional bullets** (14-16pt) - 2-3 quick points

---

## 📸 SCREEN 1: HERO / OPENING

**Visual:** Scanning screen with cosmetic label being analyzed

```
SCAN ANY PRODUCT
No database. No barcodes. Just AI.

Works with ANY cosmetic product—
even if it's not in other apps
```

**Alternative headline options:**
- "Never See 'Product Not Found' Again"
- "Analyze Everything. Even New Releases."
- "From Luxury to Homemade. We Scan It All."

---

## 📸 SCREEN 2: PROBLEM/SOLUTION

**Visual:** Split screen - competitor app showing "Product not found" vs ACS showing full analysis

```
OTHER APPS: "Product Not Found"
ACS: Full Analysis. Always.

While competitors search databases,
we use AI to analyze your photo directly
```

**Stats to include (small text):**
- Competitors cover: 33-80% of products
- ACS covers: 100% of products

---

## 📸 SCREEN 3: ONLINE SHOPPING

**Visual:** Phone screenshot showing online store product, then ACS analyzing it

```
ONLINE SHOPPING?
Just Screenshot & Analyze

• Buy cosmetics online? Screenshot the ingredients
• No barcode needed
• Works with any e-commerce site
```

**Alternative headline:**
- "Shop Online Safely"
- "Screenshot. Analyze. Decide."
- "Your Online Shopping Companion"

---

## 📸 SCREEN 4: PERSONALIZATION

**Visual:** User profile screen showing skin type, allergies, age selection

```
MADE FOR YOUR SKIN
Not Generic "Good" or "Bad"

✓ Your skin type (dry, oily, combo, sensitive)
✓ Your specific allergies
✓ Your age range

Personalized warnings just for YOU
```

**Alternative headline:**
- "Stop Using Generic Apps"
- "One Size Doesn't Fit All"
- "Rated for YOUR Skin, Not Everyone's"

---

## 📸 SCREEN 5: AI CHAT

**Visual:** Chat interface with AI explaining an ingredient

```
ASK AI ANYTHING
Education, Not Fear

"Why is this ingredient harmful?"
"Is this safe for pregnant women?"
"What's a better alternative?"

Real answers. Real science.
```

**Alternative headline:**
- "Your Personal Cosmetic Expert"
- "Learn, Don't Just Scan"
- "Questions? Just Ask AI"

---

## 📸 SCREEN 6: CONTEXT ANALYSIS

**Visual:** Analysis results showing High/Medium/Low risk categories with explanations

```
SMART ANALYSIS
Context Matters

We don't just label ingredients "bad"—
we analyze concentration, product type,
and scientific research

Science-backed, not fear-based
```

**Alternative headline:**
- "Not All 'Red' Ingredients Are Dangerous"
- "Context Over Clickbait"
- "Powered by Google Gemini AI"

---
