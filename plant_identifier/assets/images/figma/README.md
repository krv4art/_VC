# Emotion Images for Rating Dialog

This folder should contain emotion images for the rating dialog animation.

## Required Files:
- `0.png` - Neutral/No rating emotion
- `1.png` - Very bad emotion (1 star)
- `2.png` - Bad emotion (2 stars)
- `3.png` - Okay emotion (3 stars)
- `4.png` - Good emotion (4 stars)
- `5.png` - Excellent emotion (5 stars)

## Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Size**: 120x120px recommended
- **Style**: Simple, friendly emoji-style faces that match the app's botanical theme
- **Colors**: Should work with both light and dark themes

## Suggestions:
You can:
1. Design custom emotions in Figma
2. Use emoji-style faces from design libraries
3. Create simple SVG faces and export as PNG
4. Use AI image generation (DALL-E, Midjourney) with prompts like:
   - "Simple friendly plant emoji face showing [emotion], minimalist style, transparent background"

## Fallback:
If images are not found, the dialog will show a default emoji icon instead.
