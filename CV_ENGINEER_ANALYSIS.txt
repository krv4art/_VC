## CONCLUSION

CV Engineer is a well-structured, functional resume builder with:
- Solid MVP implementation (3 templates, editing, export)
- Good technical architecture (Flutter, Provider, go_router)
- Professional feature set (AI assistant, dark mode, localization)
- Multiple resume support in backend (but not UI)

Main gaps are in:
- Multiple resume management visibility
- Cloud features (Supabase setup but unused)
- Advanced features (ATS, cover letters, imports)
- Photo display in templates
- Data consistency (minor bug)
- Testing coverage

The app is production-ready for basic use but lacks competitive features found in premium resume builders like LinkedIn Resume, Canva, or Indeed Resume Builder.
